Language: TypeScript
Platform: iOS & Android mobile app
Current State (October 2025)
✅ Core Features Working
Basic cooking mode with keep-awake functionality
Recipe list view with chef attribution
Recipe detail screen with ingredients grouped by family
Admin testing panel for ingredient parsing
Connected to Supabase backend with RLS policies
✅ Database Schema Complete
User & Social:

user_profiles - extends Supabase auth
follows - social following relationships
post_likes - engagement tracking
Recipe System:

recipes - main recipe data with chef attribution
chefs - chef profiles (Molly Baz, Eden Grinshpan)
ingredients - master ingredient list with hierarchy support
recipe_ingredients - junction table with confidence scoring
recipe_ingredient_alternatives - OR pattern support
posts - cooking activity tracking
Tracking & Analytics:

or_pattern_decisions - tracks every OR pattern for learning
Views: or_pattern_analysis, migration_readiness, remaining_review_items
✅ Ingredient Parser v2.2
Parses quantities, units, and preparations from recipe text
Confidence-based matching (0.0 to 1.0 scores)
OR pattern detection ("jalapeños or fresno chiles")
Color variant recognition (red/green = equivalent)
Parent-child ingredient hierarchy (generic "sugar" vs specific types)
Flags new ingredients for database addition
Preserves original recipe text for display
Tracks all decisions for future ML migration
📊 Data Status
7 test recipes loaded
300+ ingredients in master table
OR pattern tracking active (Option A - simple rules)
Ready for Option B migration at 100+ patterns
Known Issues & TODOs
Current Issues
Some color variants still need proper detection refinement
Missing ingredients need continuous addition
Recipe display should use original_text not matched names
Next Priority Tasks
✅ Fix NaN display issue
✅ Build recipe list screen
✅ Add navigation between screens
✅ Create junction table structure
✅ Implement ingredient parser
🔄 Add user authentication (signup/login)
🔄 Create feed showing posts from followed users
🔄 Implement pantry/inventory tracking
🔄 Build smart shopping list generation

Migration Status
Option A (Current): Simple hardcoded rules for OR patterns Option B (Future): Database-driven relationships based on tracked patterns Tracking: All OR patterns logged to or_pattern_decisions table Ready at: 100+ tracked patterns (check migration_readiness view)
